# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is rolling release (commit-based) based application.

Any issue reported must be detected and reported in the deployed version,
which is stored in the [main](https://github.com/stratego-chile/site/tree/main) branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As we indicated in our [README](https://github.com/stratego-chile/site/tree/main#readme),
any vulnerability detected by the community must be reported [by email](mailto:security@stratego.cl)
or creating a security advisory in the [GitHub Security tab](https://github.com/stratego-chile/site/security/advisories).

If a vulnerability issue is related to a dependency tree package and is not resolved automatically
by the dependencies checker and is not [already reported](https://github.com/stratego-chile/site/issues),
feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/stratego-chile/site/issues/new).

Thank you for your help.
